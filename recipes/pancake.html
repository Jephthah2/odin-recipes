        <h1>Pancake</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <img src="../images/pancake.jpg" alt="A pancake" width="400">
        <p><strong>Pancakes</strong> are soft, flat and round cakes made from a batter of flour, eggs,
            milk and leavening agent like baking powder.
        </p>
        <p>They are typically cooked on a frying pan and served warm, often with toppings such as syrup,
            butter, fruits or honey.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the 
                center and add milk, melted butter and egg; mix until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto
                the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the 
                edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy</li>
        </ol>
