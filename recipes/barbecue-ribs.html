            <li>Pre heat oven to 300 degrees F(150 degrees C).Place ribs on a rack in a shallow
                roasting pan. Scatter 4 cloves of sliced garlic over ribs. Cover, and bake for 2
                1/2 hours. Cool slightly.

                powder and ground cumin. Rub spices over cooled ribs. Cover and refrigerate
